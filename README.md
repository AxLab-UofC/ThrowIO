# Application: Immersive Storytelling

## How to set up

Use one laptop and connect it to a project and an external monitor. Go to System Preferences, Displays, and you can make the laptop as the extended screen and the monitor as the main screen (which will mirror the project). Drag the toio camera screen to the laptop and drag the immersive screen to the monitor, so that the projector will only show the storytelling screen. 

We need to first launch the main ThrowIO processing script, then run the immersive processing script.

Before launching, be sure to change the applicationMode to "story".

# Application: UFO Gaming

## How to set up

Use one laptop and connect it to monitor that is placed on top of the overhanging ceiling. Make sure the gaming screen is shared on the monitor while the camera screen is shared on the laptop.

Before launching, be sure to change the applicationMode to "ufo".
